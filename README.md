# Automate Plants
 Automating watering of plants with circuitPython using Arduino Nano Rp 2040, sensors, and 120v pump connected to kasa smart strip

utilizes code from https://github.com/p-doyle/Python-KasaSmartPowerStrip/tree/CircuitPython for kasa smart strip but uses socket class from rp2040 circuit python library

**Moved and no longer have the space to implement this**
